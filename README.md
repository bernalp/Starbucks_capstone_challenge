## 1. Installation <a name="installation"></a>

## 2. Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is the final project from Udacity "Data Science Nanodegree Program" that aims to explore and uncover valuable insights into customer behavior and offer effectiveness. By examining key questions such as the popularity of different offer types, customer reactions to offers, and the impact of offer visibility, it can improve Starbucks customer base startegy.

My goal is to develop a machine learning model that can predict which customers are more likely to accept offers without even viewing them. This predictive capability will enable Starbucks to optimize their offer targeting and improve their overall marketing strategy.

By leveraging data-driven approaches and applying advanced analytics techniques, I want to provide clear answers to business questions and deliver valuable recommendations to Starbucks. Ultimately, could support Starbucks in making data-informed decisions, enhancing customer engagement, and driving business growth.

Join my journey into the data, analyze customer behavior, and unlock insights that will help Starbucks optimize their offer strategy, also create satisfying experience for their valued customers.

## 3. File Descriptions <a name="desc"></a>

- Jupyter Notebook that contain work related for this project was uploaded using `.ipynb` file.
- If you would like to access the datasets to explore more analysis, you can find `profile.json` , `portfolio.json` , and `transcript.json` file.
- To access all details about project workspace and datasets that I mentioned above, you can find in 'edit file name'

## 4. Results <a name="results"></a>

Based on my analysis of the Starbucks Challenge project, I've arrived at following conclusions and recommendations:

1. Customers with incomplete profiles and those who joined earlier are less likely to use offers. This suggests that targeting efforts should focus on customers with complete profiles and newer members to increase offer utilization.
2. Men are less likely to use offers compared to women, but they show a preference for discount over BOGO. On the other hand, women tend to use BOGO more frequently. Adjust offer types based on gender preferences can improve response rates.
3. Increase promotion through all channels to enhance offer visibility and reach a wider audience.
4. Shorten the offer duration to a 3-7 days to create a sense of urgency and prompting them to take immediate action and make a purchase.
5. Adjust offer difficulty level. If an offer's too difficult, customers may didn't interested engage with it. By creating offers that attainable and rewarding, the company can increase customer participation and encourage more spending.
6. Leverage the potential of discount offers, as the completion rate is 78% among customers who viewed them. By effectively showcasing the benefits of the discount offers and promoting it, customers may encouraged to spend more to take advantage of limited-time discount. This also result increased sales and revenue for the company.

Additionally, based on model's evaluation, it's represent that LightGBM significantly improves prediction performance compared to Logistic Regression and Downsampling. Higher Precision, Accuracy, Recall, and F1 Score demonstrate it's effectiveness in identifying customers likely to waste offers.

These conclusions and recommendations provide valuable insights to improve offer strategy, customer engagement, and marketing effectiveness in offer's utilization. These will leading to maximize business ROI (Return of Investments).
